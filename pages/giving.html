                            <h2>CEMINA</h2>
                            <p>CEMINA was founded by a group of women activists in Brazil who struggled to find a way to communicate with the public about aspirations,
                                wishes, rights, and changes that women seek for themselves and for society as a whole.
                                Through broadcast radio, CEMINA works to provide a platform for women to have a voice, air their opinions, and speak
                                candidly about issues
                                related to gender and human rights.
                                Over the last decade, CEMINA has expanded to educate underserved communities of Brazil, providing access to a range of information and
                                communication channels at low-to-no cost. </p>
                            <h4>Climate change has no boundaries: Help rural Brazil</h4>
                            <p>Bahia is the fourth most populated state in Brazil and one of the poorest regions.
                                Semi-arid, climate conditions prove challenging for nearly two million households that face periods of drought.
                                In partnership with CEMINA, Adapta Sertão is giving young farmers in the region access to water, efficient irrigation,
                                and innovative technologies.

                            <p>The world is experiencing a global housing crisis.

                                In 2011, Habitat for Humanity served 81,399 families worldwide.
                                As a result, about a quarter of a million more people are living in better housing, and are equipped to improve
                                their lives and their livelihoods. </p>
                            <p>Each year, Wells&nbsp;Fargo team members volunteer with Habitat for Humanity all around the world, including Dublin, Hong Kong, London,
